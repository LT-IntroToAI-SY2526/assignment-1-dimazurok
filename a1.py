"""
MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with Java and Java script. 
Can you create 5 practice problems that cover: 
- Variables and basic data types 
- Conditionals (if/elif/else) 
- For loops and while loops 
- Functions 
- Basic list operations 
Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs.

"""
PROBLEM 1: [Simple Calculator (Variables & Data Types)]
Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and then prints the result of adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing them.

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Should return:
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0

PROBLEM 2: [Grade Checker (Conditonals)]
Write a program that asks the user to enter a test score (0â€“100) 
and prints the letter grade based on the following:

Enter your score: 85
Should return:
You got a B!

PROBLEM 3: [Multiples of a number (Loops)]
Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints all 
the multiples of that number from 1 to 100.

Enter a number: 25
Should return:
25
50
75
100

PROBLEM 4: [Password Validator (Functions + Loops + Conditionals)]
Write a function is_valid_password(password) that checks if a password 
is valid. A valid password:

Is at least 8 characters long

Contains at least one number

Contains at least one uppercase letter

Then, use a loop to keep asking the user to enter a password until 
they enter a valid one.

Enter a password: hello
Invalid password. Try again.
Enter a password: Hello123
Password accepted!

PROBLEM 5: [List Statistics (Lists + FWrite a program that asks the 
user to enter a series of numbers (separated by spaces), and then:

Converts them into a list of integers

Defines a function to compute the average, maximum, and minimum

Prints the resultsunctions + Loops)]

Enter numbers separated by spaces: 5 10 15 20
Should return:
Average: 12.5
Maximum: 20
Minimum: 5

"""
Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False

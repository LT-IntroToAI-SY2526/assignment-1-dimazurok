# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
Python is very similar to Java. I enjoyed using python for the first time. 
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI for problems for me to solve. I used AI to help me with ideas and key points for creating my solutions.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
Towards the last 2 problems, the problems became a lot more confusing so it took me longer to figure out. With the use of AI I was given some tips which led me to completing the problems.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
Writing a good prompt helped a lot more. A good prompt led to better tips for me to use towards my problem solving.
